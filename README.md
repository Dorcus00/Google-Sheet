In this project, i investigated access to safe and affordable drinking water focussing on inequalities in services levels between different countries and regions.
The data is from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene JMP
I analyzed the data using google sheets
The analysis aimed at investigating;
how the world population estimates compare to the provided dataset populations
how the urban population share compare to the rural population
the tendency and spread of the different water access features
how these measures of water access compare across different types of areas
what the national access to water look like based on national population size
what the urban access to water look like based on urban population size
what the rural access look like
the effect of national population size and urbanisation on GNI and water access
