This is the first part of the project where i investigated access to safe and affordable drinking water focussing on inequalities in services levels between different countries and regions.
The data is from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene JMP.
I analyzed the data using google sheets.
The analysis aimed at investigating;
how the world population estimates compare to the provided dataset populations,
how the urban population share compare to the rural population,
the tendency and spread of the different water access features,
how these measures of water access compare across different types of areas,
what the national access to water look like based on national population size,
what the urban access to water look like based on urban population size,
what the rural access look like,
the effect of national population size and urbanisation on GNI and water access.

In this second part of the integrated project, i extended my investigation on access to safe and affordable drinking water by creating features, summaries, and visualisations. 
It aimed at investigating;
how the imported dataset differ from the Estimates on the use of water 2020 dataset,
the years represented within the dataset by sorting by both name and year,
the average year difference per country,
the Annual Rates Change ARC for the national, rural, and urban areas per country,
the average of the different ARCs for all countries,
how access to basic water change over time for different areas,
how the ARC differ between rural and urban populations,
how the ARC compare across different regions,
how the national population size influence the ARC.
