In this second part of the integrated project, i extended my investigation on access to safe and affordable drinking water by creating features, summaries, and visualisations. 
It aimed at investigating; 
how the imported dataset differ from the Estimates on the use of water 2020 dataset, 
the years represented within the dataset by sorting by both name and year, 
the average year difference per country, 
the Annual Rates Change ARC for the national, rural, and urban areas per country, 
the average of the different ARCs for all countries, 
how access to basic water change over time for different areas, 
how the ARC differ between rural and urban populations,
how the ARC compare across different regions, 
how the national population size influence the ARC.
